# Calculated Earth

[calculatedearth.com]() was created back in 2007. Further details can be found on the [about](https://calculatedearth.com/about) page.

It has remained largely untouched since then, with a few minor updated to cover things like GDPR requirements.

That should hopefully explain the now somewhat dated style of code used throughout. That said, it still works, so... :)

Pull requests for fixes, updates, improvements and new features are most welcome.

### Todos

- [x] Convert site from dynamic to rendered to static build.
- [x] Move static site and build tools to public Github repo.
- [ ] Add original data and created tools to render sea level images. (Some searching through archives required.)
